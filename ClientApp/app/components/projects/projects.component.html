                <h2>Azure Cloud Solutions</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="popup-body">
                <h3>Architectural and Infrastructural Design</h3>
                <p>Depending on the specific needs of a project, there are simplier and more cost-effective ways of creating
                    the same product. Azure provides many paths including virtual machines, web/mobile/logic/API apps, microservices
                    - just to name a few. Architectural and infrastructural designs are the first and most crucial steps
                    before the actual implementation of a solution. I have provided several hours of consultation and also
                    have hands-on experience with complete projects that required the design and creation of cloud solutions
                    for small- to mid-size start-ups from the ground up.</p>
                <h3>Hybrid and Pure-cloud Solutions</h3>
                <p>One of the main strengths of Azure is its support for hybrid solutions, i.e. on-premises networks connected
                    to virtual networks in the cloud. This can be an ideal path when a company wants to keep certain data
                    on its private servers or uses Windows Active Directory to manage different entities while also enabling
                    SSO (Single Sign-on) when using third-party software. I have had projects using Azure logic apps to connect
                    to local SQL databases, set up connections between virtual networks and on-premises ones and also have
                    experience with B2B and B2C Azure Active Directory solutions.</p>
                <h3>Microservices</h3>
                <p>Microservices are the newest buzzword in cloud technology. I have been experiencing a surge in demand in
                    microservices since the second half of 2017. While microservices have tremendous power when it comes
                    to scalability and cost saving, they require a totally different approach to software development and
                    maintanance and are usually not ideal for a large portion of small to mid-size web applications present
                    today. During one of my projects in 2017, although my client finally decided to use conventional approaches
                    rather than microservices, I had the chance to make experiments with Azure capabilities regarding this
                    field. I also keep myself up-to-date with Azure's newest advencements and can give you detailed information
                    on Azure's capabilities with microservices when needed.</p>

                <h3>AWS to Azure Migration</h3>
                <p>As Azure is trying to be more competitive with AWS, I see an increasing demand in partial and complete migrations
                    from AWS to Azure. Also, as some third-party service providers work with clients using different cloud
                    platforms, third-party providers need working solutions on different cloud platforms, i.e. hybrid-cloud
                    solutions.
                </p>
                <p>I managed a complete AWS-to-Azure migration including virtual machine, data and database migration (using
                    private VPN connection between virtual networks), and infrastructure replication.</p>

                <h3>Online Gaming Platform</h3>
                <p>During 2016, I founded a start-up company named oneremains with the goal to create a multiplayer online gaming
                    platform combining skill- and logic-based games in a single mobile app, enabling players to participate
                    in both monetary and non-monetary tournaments across the world. The project involved a high level of
                    international project management through offices in Germany and the US and the coordination of suppliers
                    through the development of a diverse set of games.</p>
                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <p>While the project had to be ended due to financial difficulties at the end of 2016, I learnt a tremendous
                    amount of invaluable information and gained significant hands-on experience with mainstream technologies.
                    The project included the design and development of a complex and scalable back-end architecture using
                    continuous web-socket communication among different application layers in Amazon AWS using Node.js, multiplayer
                    networking with client applications using Unity3D built on .NET.</p>

                <h3>Automated Stock Trading Application</h3>
                <p>As one of my side projects, I developed and implemented an investment strategy based on technical financials.
                    It uses short- to mid-term patterns and has been historically profitable back to 2010.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="popup-body">
                <h3>.NET and .NET Core</h3>
                <p>As of Nov 2017, I tend to use .NET Core rather than .NET whenever it comes to the creation of an app from
                    the ground up. While .NET Core libraries are slightly immature compared to the ones of .NET used for
                    years, its simplified libraries and cross-platform capabilities are definitely a huge advantage.</p>
                <h3>ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core 2.0</h3>
                <p>I first started working with ASP.NET MVC and, with time, continued using ASP.NET Core 2.0 more and more.
                    When a new back-end needs to be created from scratch, I always suggest using .NET Core-based technologies
                    instead of the conventional ones tied to Windows. ASP.NET Core has several advantages over ASP.NET MVC.
                    For example, it has its own dependency injection manager and Web API and MVC have been merged into one
                    module. As both technologies are very similar to one another despite these basic differences, I am happy
                    to help my clients with older versions of .NET as well.</p>
                <h3>Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core</h3>
                <p>As of Nov 2017, Entity Framework Core's library is slightly less mature than the traditional Windows-based
                    one. However, I have not faced any larger difficulties that would have made the implementation significantly
                    harder or more time-consuming. Again, both frameworks are very similar and, hence, I can use either one
                    depending on the project's needs.
