            </div>
            <div class="popup-body">
                <h3>Architectural and Infrastructural Design</h3>
                <p>Depending on the specific needs of a project, there are simplier and more cost-effective ways of creating
                    the same product. Azure provides many paths including virtual machines, web/mobile/logic/API apps, microservices
                    - just to name a few. Architectural and infrastructural designs are the first and most crucial steps
                    before the actual implementation of a solution. I have provided several hours of consultation and also
                    have hands-on experience with complete projects that required the design and creation of cloud solutions
                    for small- to mid-size start-ups from the ground up.</p>
                <h3>Hybrid and Pure-cloud Solutions</h3>
                <p>One of the main strengths of Azure is its support for hybrid solutions, i.e. on-premises networks connected
                    to virtual networks in the cloud. This can be an ideal path when a company wants to keep certain data
                    on its private servers or uses Windows Active Directory to manage different entities while also enabling
                    SSO (Single Sign-on) when using third-party software. I have had projects using Azure logic apps to connect
                    to local SQL databases, set up connections between virtual networks and on-premises ones and also have
                    experience with B2B and B2C Azure Active Directory solutions.</p>
                <h3>Microservices</h3>
                <p>Microservices are the newest buzzword in cloud technology. I have been experiencing a surge in demand in
                    microservices since the second half of 2017. While microservices have tremendous power when it comes
                    to scalability and cost saving, they require a totally different approach to software development and
                    maintanance and are usually not ideal for a large portion of small to mid-size web applications present
                    today. During one of my projects in 2017, although my client finally decided to use conventional approaches
                    rather than microservices, I had the chance to make experiments with Azure capabilities regarding this
                    field. I also keep myself up-to-date with Azure's newest advencements and can give you detailed information
                    on Azure's capabilities with microservices when needed.</p>

                <h3>AWS to Azure Migration</h3>
                <p>As Azure is trying to be more competitive with AWS, I see an increasing demand in partial and complete migrations
                    from AWS to Azure. Also, as some third-party service providers work with clients using different cloud
                    platforms, third-party providers need working solutions on different cloud platforms, i.e. hybrid-cloud
                    solutions. I managed a complete AWS-to-Azure migration including virtual machine, data and database migration
                    (using private VPN connection between virtual networks), and infrastructure replication.</p>

                <h3>Online Gaming Platform</h3>
                <p>During 2016, I founded a start-up company named oneremains with the goal to create a multiplayer online gaming
                    platform combining skill- and logic-based games in a single mobile app, enabling players to participate
                    in both monetary and non-monetary tournaments across the world. The project involved a high level of
                    international project management through offices in Germany and the US and the coordination of suppliers
                    through the development of a diverse set of games.</p>
                <h3>Technologies Used in the oneremains Project</h3>
                <p>While the project had to be ended due to financial difficulties at the end of 2016, I learnt a tremendous
                    amount of invaluable information and gained significant hands-on experience with mainstream technologies.
                    The project included the design and development of a complex and scalable back-end architecture using
                    continuous web-socket communication among different application layers in Amazon AWS using
                    Node.js, multiplayer networking with client applications using Unity3D built on .NET.</p>
