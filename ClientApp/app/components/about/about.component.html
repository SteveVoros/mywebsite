      <p>Regardless of your project's size, I can help you tackle challenges in front-end and back-end development using Angular
        and .NET, elaborate architectural concepts using pure-cloud or hybrid-cloud solutions, and implement them at both
        an infrastructural and code level.</p>
      <p>Whether you just need a professional for an one-hour consultation or one that can jump into your boat with some aspiring
        goals set ahead, I am ready to help you. I keep myself up-to-date with the newest developments in the industry and
        aspire to use them in my projects every day.</p>
      <p>I have solid coding skills and acquired significant experience through diverse projects along the way. I used to work
        for one of the most renown luxury carmakers and so I believe I know quite a bit about reliability, precision, and
        quality of work. Besides my solid carrier at a multinational corporation, I always wanted to challenge myself by
        founding my own start-up company. There, I functioned as a lead developer for a team of five and multiple contractors.
        I needed to learn about the importance of flexibility that I consider one of my greatest strengths even today.</p>
