                <h2>Azure Cloud Solutions</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="popup-body">
                <h3>Architectural and Infrastructural Design</h3>
                <p>Depending on the specific needs of a project, there are simplier and more cost-effective ways of creating
                    the same product. Azure provides diverse paths for that purpose such as virtual machines (IaaS), Web/Mobile/Logic/API
                    apps (PaaS), and microservices - just to name a few. Architectural and infrastructural designs are the
                    first and most crucial steps before the actual implementation of a solution. I have provided several
                    hours of consultation and also have hands-on experience with end-to-end projects that required the design
                    and creation of cloud solutions for small- to mid-size companies from the ground up.</p>
                <h3>Hybrid and Pure-cloud Solutions</h3>
                <p>One of the main strengths of Azure is its support for hybrid solutions, i.e. on-premises networks connected
                    to virtual networks in the cloud. This can be an ideal path when a company wants to keep sensitive data
                    on its private servers or uses Windows Active Directory to manage different entities while also enabling
                    SSO (Single Sign-on) when using third-party software. I have had projects using Azure logic apps to connect
                    to local SQL databases, set up connections between cloud-based virtual networks and on-premises ones
                    and also have experience with B2B and B2C Azure Active Directory solutions.</p>
                <h3>IoT and Azure Event Hub</h3>
                <p>In my largest project in 2017, a cloud-based solution needed to be implemented to collect, organize, and
                    analyze data coming from wireless IoT devices. The project involved the heavy use of Azure Event Hub,
                    Stream Analytics, Notification Hub, and Azure Service Bus.</p>
                <h3>Microservices</h3>
                <p>Microservices are the newest buzzword in cloud technology. I have been experiencing a surge in the demand
                    of microservices since the second half of 2017. While microservices have tremendous power when it comes
                    to scalability and cost saving, they require a totally different approach to software development and
                    the maintanance of such solutions and are usually not ideal for a large portion of small to mid-size
                    web applications present today. During one of my projects in 2017, I had the chance to make experiments
                    with Azure capabilities regarding this field, although my client and I finally decided to use a conventional
                    cloud-based infrastructure rather than microservices. I also keep myself up-to-date with Azure's newest
                    advencements and can give you detailed information on Azure's capabilities with regard to microservices
                    whenever needed.</p>
                <h3>Other Technologies</h3>
                <p>There are several other Azure technologies I used along the way:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Azure KeyVault</li>
                    <li>Azure API Management</li>
                    <li>Azure Automation</li>
                    <li>Traffic Manager / Load Balancer / Application Gateway</li>
                    <li>Azure Functions</li>
                    <li>Azure-specific databases such as DocumentDB and Azure SQL, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>AWS to Azure Migration</h3>
                <p>As Azure is trying to be more competitive with AWS, I see an increasing demand in partial and complete migrations
                    from AWS to Azure. Also, as some third-party service providers work with clients using different cloud
                    platforms, providers need working solutions on different cloud platforms, i.e. hybrid-cloud solutions.
                </p>
                <p>I successfully completed an AWS-to-Azure migration including virtual machine, data and database migration
                    (by setting up private VPN connection between virtual networks), and infrastructure replication.</p>

                <h3>Online Gaming Platform</h3>
                <p>During 2016, I founded a start-up company named oneremains with the goal to create a multiplayer gaming platform
                    combining skill- and logic-based games in a single mobile app, enabling players to participate in both
                    monetary and non-monetary tournaments across the world. The project involved a high level of international
                    project management through offices in Germany and the US and the coordination of suppliers through the
                    development of a diverse set of games.</p>
                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <p>While the project had to be ended due to financial difficulties at the end of 2016, I learnt a tremendous
                    amount of invaluable information and gained significant hands-on experience with mainstream technologies.
                    The project included the design and development of a complex and scalable back-end architecture using
                    continuous web-socket communication between master servers and game agents, the automated start and stop
                    of game agents based on demand, the server-authoritative multiplayer networking, and a front-end facing
                    mobile app. Main technologies used during development: Node.js for master servers, .NET-based UNet and
                    Unity for multiplayer networking and game development, Sails.js, SocketIO, MongoDB and SQL.</p>

                <p>As one of my side projects, I developed and implemented an investment strategy based on technical financials.
                    It uses short- to mid-term patterns and has been historically profitable back to 2010.</p>

                <p>The trading bot is a .NET console application that pulls and analyzes level-one stock data from eoddata on
                    a daily basis. Based on trend-related criteria, the bot automatically invests in stocks and ETFs using
                    Interactive Brokers' API. The bot runs in the form of a .NET Core console application on an Azure virtual
                    machine.

            <div class="popup-body">
                <h3>.NET and .NET Core</h3>
                <p>As of Nov 2017, I tend to use .NET Core rather than .NET whenever it comes to the creation of an app from
                    the ground up. While the number of .NET Core libraries is slightly lower compared to the third-party
                    of .NET used for years, .NET Core is incredibly fast and its cross-platform capabilities and simplified
                    structure are definitely of a huge advantage.</p>
                <h3>ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core 2</h3>
                <p>I first started working with ASP.NET MVC and, with time, continued using ASP.NET Core 2 more and more. When
                    a new back-end needs to be created from scratch, I always suggest using .NET Core-based technologies
                    instead of the traditional ones due to its great performance and the cross-platform flexibility. ASP.NET
                    Core has additional advantages over ASP.NET MVC. For example, it has its own dependency injection manager.
                    Also, Web API and MVC have been merged into one module so no need to learn two different libraries. However,
                    as MVC/Web API and Core resemble alot to one another despite these basic differences, I am happy to help
                    my clients with older versions of .NET as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core</h3>
                <p>As of Nov 2017, Entity Framework Core's library is slightly less mature than the traditional Windows-based
                    one. However, I have not faced any larger difficulties that would have made the implementation significantly
                    more complex or time-consuming. Again, both frameworks are very similar and, hence, I can use either
                    one depending on the project's needs.
